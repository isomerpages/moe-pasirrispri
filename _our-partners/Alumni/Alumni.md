# **Alumni**

PRPS Alumni serves as a link between ex-Pasirians and our alma mater. It was formalised on 4 April 2009. It aims to sustain a sense of belonging in our present batches of students and develop the capability to continue to engage those who have graduated. It will offer alumni opportunities to participate in a variety of educational and cultural programmes, to socialise with other graduates and a chance to rekindle old friendships.

### Vision

*   To create a strong and committed alumni
*   To strengthen rootedness and the PRPS Spirit
*   To deepen the “heart-ware” of Singapore

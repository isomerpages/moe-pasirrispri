 **Principal’s Message**

Dear Pasirians,

At Pasir Ris Primary School, each and every child is precious to us. Guided by our philosophy that “every child is a winner”, we are committed to developing all of our students holistically: instilling in them a joy of learning through both the curriculum and co-curriculum, nurturing them to be leaders with integrity and building in them a spirit of excellence in everything that they do. We are committed to a caring and supportive school environment for all students, helping them to learn and grow as individuals and as part of our larger Pasirian family.

Guided by our school mission and values, we seek to develop our students’ confidence, compassion and critical thinking through the learning experiences that they undergo, including our signature iSeries programme, through which students discover and deepen their talents and interests, and our Learn for Life Programmes (LLP) in Sports and Student Leadership. As the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Character and Citizenship Education (EZ COE CCE), we seek to build our students’ character, inculcate values and nurture within them a heart for service to the community.

We recognize education as a lifelong journey and aim to instill in our students competencies and qualities that will stand them in good stead to meet future challenges. Ultimately, we desire for our students to be resilient **Lifelong Learners** with the capacity to learn from every experience, including failure, and bounce back even stronger, as well as **Active Contributors** who put others before self and give without counting the cost.

To achieve these outcomes, we value our partnerships with parents and stakeholders. As our students embark on their educational journey, let us build a strong partnership based on mutual understanding, respect and trust, so that we can journey alongside them meaningfully, giving them the support they need to help them realize our school motto “Be Our Best”!

Yours sincerely,

Tan King Ming

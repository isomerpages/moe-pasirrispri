# **Vision, Mission and Philosophy**

### Vision

Lifelong Learners, Active Citizens.

### Mission

Nurturing Pasirians to be confident and compassionate critical thinkers.

### Philosophy

We believe that :

**Every Child is a Winner.**

Every child can learn and achieve to the maximum of his potential given the proper guidance and nurturing. As teachers, we are in “the business of enhancing lives”. We make a great difference in every child’s behaviour, motivation and achievement. By keeping fit and by taking care of our own health and professional growth, we can contribute more to our children’s growth and development. Parents are our partners in education. We will work closely with parents and the community to achieve our mission of preparing our children for the challenges of the future.

# **School Crest, School Song and School Motto**

### School Crest

<img src="/images/logo.png" style="width:25%">

*   The focal point of our school crest is the eight-sided star.
*   The star symbolises our philosophical belief that “Every Child is a Winner”.
*   It also represents our quest to bring out the star quality in every child
*   The two contrasting colours within each arm depict a need for balance for an enriching life.
*   The bold ring encircling the star symbolises an all-round education.

### Aims of Art Education

The aims of art education are to enable every child to be visually literate and to appreciate art. Being visually literate means pupils are able to observe, understand and make meaning of what they see. They are also able to communicate their ideas by using and creating visuals. Being able to appreciate art means pupils will be able to see the value and recognise the relevance of art in their lives.

### Programme for Active Learning (PAL) – Music & Performing Arts For Primary 1 & 2 only

The Programme for Active Learning, also known as PAL, is one of PERI’s recommendations to address the increased emphasis on holistic education and development of life skills. It provides a smooth transition for children from pre-school child to primary education.  With Primary 1 and 2 pupils in mind, PAL emphasises learning through hands-on experiences, having fun and enjoyment in the learning, and on-going opportunities for peer interaction and self-discovery. PAL Visual Art module uses experiential learning to provide pupils with authentic opportunities to explore and express themselves creatively through art. Pupils learn about animal conservation and how their actions affect others. PAL is conducted over 2 hrs weekly over and above Art Lessons.

Photography is relevant in pupils’ daily life and is a common form of expression and communication in society today.

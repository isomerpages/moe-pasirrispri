The Programme for Active Learning, also known as PAL, is one of PERI’s recommendations to address the increased emphasis on holistic education and development of life skills. It provides a smooth transition for children from pre-school child to primary education.  With Primary 1 and 2 pupils in mind, PAL emphasises learning through hands-on experiences, having fun and enjoyment in the learning, and on-going opportunities for peer interaction and self-discovery. PAL Music and Performing Arts modules use experiential learning to provide pupils with authentic opportunities to explore and express themselves creatively through music and movement. PAL is conducted over 2hrs weekly over and above Music lessons.

It has been a long standing tradition in Pasir Ris Primary School that we celebrate the nation’s National Day with our annual  
‘Sing Singapore’. Sing Singapore has served as a platform for our pupils to showcase their learning in the Arts. Besides learning the General Music Syllabus, performing arts components are integrated into the curriculum to build confidence and instill a sense of rootedness to the country. All pupils in Pasir Ris Primary will learn one form of dance each year. All Pri 1 -3  
will dress up to sing and dance during Sing Singapore in the spirit of celebrating our nation’s birthday.

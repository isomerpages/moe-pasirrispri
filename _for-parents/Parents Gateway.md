# **Parents Gateway**

Dear Parents,

Parents Gateway is a mobile app specially designed for parents. Developed by MOE and GovTech, the app allows parents to engage closely with schools, receive information and perform a range of administrative functions including giving consent for school trips.

We will transit fully to PG with effect from 1 Jan 2020. To ease the transition, all official school announcements will be sent through ASKnlearn and Parents Gateway with effect from 1 Nov 2019 until 31 Dec 2019.

Please download the one-time onboarding instruction guide to get started.

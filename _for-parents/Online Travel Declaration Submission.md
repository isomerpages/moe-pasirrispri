# **Online Travel Declaration Submission**

**TRAVEL DECLARATION**  

Before the start of every school holiday, **all Primary 1 to 6 students** are to declare their travel plans regardless of travel intent via Parents Gateway (PG).

Fill in the online travel declaration form by going through the following steps:

**Parents Gateway**

If you have more than 1 child, and the declarations details are the same, please select all of them and make only 1 declaration, even if they are in different schools.

We will also appreciate for those who are not travelling to make a “Not Travelling” declaration.

Only 1 parent is required to declare. You may refer to the following steps or the slides attached for more information:

1\. Download and install the latest version of Parents Gateway App v5.2.0

2\. Go to \[SERVICES > DECLARE TRAVELS\] to make your declaration.

Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) complement the school curriculum as it provides students with a balanced development across the aesthetics, cognitive, moral, physical and social-emotional domains.

CCA enables students to develop character, values and to discover their interests and talents.  It is also one of the platform that provide authentic opportunities for building friendship and allow students to work as a team towards a common goal.

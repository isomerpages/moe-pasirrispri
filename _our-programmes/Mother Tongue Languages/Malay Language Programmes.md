### MT Cultural Fortnight Week

Mother Tongue Cultural Fortnight is a platform for students to understand and develop a lifelong interest in Mother Tongue language and its culture. A variety of activities that promote experiential and engaging learning were organised to expose them to the rich Malay culture.

There are different activities planned for each level, for example, Gamelan for Primary 3 students,&nbsp;Silat for Primary 4 students and traditional games for Primary 5 students.

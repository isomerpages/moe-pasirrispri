In PRPS, we believe in helping every student find joy in learning and using technology to empower them to learn better and at the same time preparing them as future-ready and responsible digital learners.

### Key Programmes

**ICT in Teaching and Learning**

The school adopts a spiral approach in preparing our students to acquire ICT skills and knowledge and Cyber Wellness (collaboration with the CCE Department) in an ICT-enriched curriculum. Every student would undergo Baseline ICT Standards Programme during their 6-year education in the school. The Baseline ICT Standards is a set of ICT skill competencies set out in the Learning Outcomes under the New Media Literacies Programme. These represent the basic level of knowledge, skills and values that students need in order to fully benefit from a curriculum enriched with ICT, and eventually thrive in a technology-driven society. In addition, students are also taught two critical cyber wellness aspects – namely, ethical and legal use, and safe and responsible use.

**P5 Code For Fun Programme (CFF)**    

Code for Fun (CFF) provides opportunity for our P5 students to learn Computational Thinking through coding. Students will undergo a 10-hour compulsory programme during curriculum. Through this programme, they will develop an appreciation of core computational thinking and coding concepts through simple visual programming-based lessons co-developed by MOE and IMDA. They would also be exposed to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.

**Cyber Wellness**      

The school adopts the MOE Cyber Wellness Framework. The Framework focuses on developing the child’s instinct to protect himself and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace. The framework highlights two principles to guide students in their actions, describes a 3-step process to explore cyber wellness issues and encourages schools to partner parents in promoting cyber wellness among students.

In PRPS, selected students are trained to take on the role of Cyber Wellness Ambassadors and Cyber Wellness Monitors to promote awareness of cyber wellness issues and values amongst their peers, as well as to instil a positive cyber culture in school.

Cyber Wellness Talks are conducted during Assemblies and Life skills lessons are integrated into the curriculum to further guide our students in protecting themselves in the Cyber World.

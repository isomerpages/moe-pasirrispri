In PRPS, we believe in helping every student find joy in learning and using technology to empower them to learn better and at the same time preparing them as future-ready and responsible digital learners.

### Key Programmes

**ICT in Teaching and Learning**

The school adopts a spiral approach in preparing our students to acquire ICT skills and knowledge and Cyber Wellness (collaboration with the CCE Department) in an ICT-enriched curriculum. Every student would undergo Baseline ICT Standards Programme during their 6-year education in the school. The Baseline ICT Standards is a set of ICT skill competencies set out in the Learning Outcomes under the New Media Literacies Programme. These represent the basic level of knowledge, skills and values that students need in order to fully benefit from a curriculum enriched with ICT, and eventually thrive in a technology-driven society. In addition, students are also taught two critical cyber wellness aspects â€“ namely, ethical and legal use, and safe and responsible use.

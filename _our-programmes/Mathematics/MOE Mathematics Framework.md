# **MOE Mathematics Framework**

The framework of the mathematics curriculum summarises the essence of mathematics teaching and learning in schools. The learning of mathematics at all levels involves more than the basic acquisition of concepts and skills. It also crucially involves an understanding of the underlying mathematical thinking, the general strategies of problem solving and positive attitudes to and appreciation of mathematics as an important and powerful tool in everyday life.

The framework (shown above) shows the underlying principles of an effective mathematics programme that is applicable to all levels, from the primary to A-levels. It sets the direction for the teaching, learning, and assessment of mathematics. Mathematical problem solving is central to mathematics learning. It involves the acquisition and application of mathematics concepts and skills in a wide range of situations, including non-routine, open-ended and real-world problems.

The development of mathematical problem solving ability is dependent on five inter-related components, namely, _Concepts_, _Skills_, _Processes_, _Attitudes_ and _Metacognition_.

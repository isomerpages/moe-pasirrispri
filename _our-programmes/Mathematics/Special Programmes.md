### School Maths Trail

The Maths Dept annually organises Maths Trails to create awareness that Maths is all around us. Pupils use mathematical concepts and skills to make discoveries and draw conclusions about the world around them. Maths Trails inspire a sense of fun in learning, encourage children to view things from a mathematical perspective and give them tangible as well as concrete mathematical experience to encourage learning. It also brings abstract mathematical concepts to life. In the face of advancing technological progress, the school has harnessed various ICT tools to engage our pupils in Maths Trails â€“ from leveraging on Tablet PC to iPhone to iPAD. As pupils work in small groups, they also pick up important life skills through teamwork, for example, effective communication, taking turns and showing respect for others, etc.

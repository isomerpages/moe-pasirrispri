# **Special Programmes**

### School Maths Trail

The Maths Dept annually organizes Maths Trails to create awareness that Maths is all around us. Students use mathematical concepts and skills to make discoveries and draw conclusions about the world around them. Maths Trails inspire a sense of fun in learning, encourage students to view things from a mathematical perspective, and give them tangible and concrete mathematical experiences to promote understanding. It also brings abstract mathematical concepts to life. In the face of advancing technological progress, the school has harnessed various ICT tools to engage our students in Maths Trails â€“ from leveraging Tablet PC to iPhones to iPad. As students work in small groups, they also pick up essential life skills through teamwork, such as effective communication, taking turns, showing respect for others, etc.

A week in Term 3 is designated Maths Fun Week for all P1-6 students. The aim is to instill a love for the subject through games and fun-filled activities. Students move from station to station around the school to engage in problem-solving challenges, such as the Tower of Hanoi. ICT is infused in some activities to inject enjoyment while embracing technology.

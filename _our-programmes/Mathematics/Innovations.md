**ENHANCED LEARNING IN MATHEMATICS THROUGH MUSIC, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NAFA**

![](/images/mathematics.jpg)

_Music in Maths__,_ a collaborative project between Pasir Ris Primary School (PRPS) and Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA), aims to promote higher engagement in mathematics learning through songs, simple dance steps and musical experiences.  The project began in 2012, shortly after a Mathematics Department meeting to brainstorm strategies to make learning mathematics more enjoyable for the Pri 3 (P3) students.

Research has shown that music aids in relaxation and has a positive influence on learning.  As children love music and singing, members of the Mathematics Department thought of weaving mathematical terms into songs for all P3 topics for teachers to use as tuning-in activities.

The collaborative effort with the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) involved the Mathematics teachers in writing lyrics for all P3 topics and the NAFA students refining the lyrics and adding melody, rhythm and structure in a creative and imaginative way to the lyrics.  The collaboration went beyond the creative process. Every year in March, NAFA students conduct Music-Maths sessions with all P3 classes.  A typical session introduces students to the various musical instruments used to produce the mathematics song before they sing it.  It is hoped that students would find joy in learning mathematics and be more motivated to do well in the subject.

During the first phase of implementation in 2012-13, data from a survey conducted with the P3 students revealed that:

*   5% found the songs interesting
*   4% found the songs easy to learn
*   1% felt the songs aroused their interest in learning Mathematics
*   4% felt the songs helped them remember something about the Mathematics topics

Here are the comments by some teachers.

_“The students were enthusiastically engaged.  They danced and sang to the rhythm of the song … they learnt mathematics while singing.”  – Elizabeth Choo & Ong Kian Kie._

_“The lessons by NAFA really got them engaged in learning mathematics.  Although motivated initially to participate in the music segment, without them realising it, the students were also grasping mathematical concepts in a fun and happy environment.  I highly recommend this collaboration.”  – Muhd Fariq_

The positive feedback encouraged PRPS to sustain its partnership with NAFA for four years despite some challenges.  Through this journey, PRPS learnt the importance of careful planning and management of the partnership.  Clear communication, commitment and clarification of expectations are necessary to achieve the desired outcomes of the project.  The team faced the initial challenges of arranging for regular, face to face conversations to communicate requests or clarifications.  Differences in priorities and time schedules also meant that the NAFA students, constrained by their schedules, could not deliver requirements within the proposed time frame.  Furthermore, the yearly change in batches of NAFA students made it challenging to move the project to the next, higher level.

These challenges notwithstanding, the shared beliefs and goals between PRPS and NAFA have helped to sustain this meaningful, symbiotic collaboration.   PRPS is thankful to NAFA for its continual support all these years.

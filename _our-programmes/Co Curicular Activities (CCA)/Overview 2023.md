Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) play a vital role in enhancing the educational experiences of our students by providing them with opportunities to develop their skills, knowledge, and interests beyond the classroom. These activities are designed to offer a well-rounded development of students, covering areas such as aesthetics, cognitive, sports and social-emotional well-being. 
Through their participation in CCA, students are able to explore and discover their passions, interests, and skills. This exploration can help students build self-confidence, foster their creativity, and develop a strong sense of self-identity. 

The CCA program is also designed to provide students with opportunities to enhance their character and 21st-century competencies through planned and meaningful activities. It provides a platform for students to form meaningful relationships and friendships, as well as collaborate with others to achieve common goals. By participating in these experiences, students have the opportunity to develop new skills

**Three main Categories of CCA**

The school provides a diverse selection of Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) organized into three main groups, offering students a wide range of options to choose from based on their interests and skills. The availability of a variety of CCAs allows students to find an activity that aligns with their interests and supports their personal growth. The grouping of CCAs into three main categories helps to simplify the selection process and provides students with a clear understanding of the different options available to them. The school's commitment to offering a comprehensive and inclusive CCA program is a testament to its dedication to providing students with opportunities for holistic development.

**Primary 2 CCA Modular Experience Program (MEP)**

The program is designed to give our students an opportunity to explore their interests and discover their strengths. This program aims to provide a hands-on and engaging experience for Primary 2 students by allowing them to try out **three different** CCAs. This will help them to identify the activities that they enjoy the most and have the potential to excel in. The program is designed to be inclusive and all Primary 2 students are strongly encouraged to participate. The MEP is a valuable experience that will lay the foundation for students to make informed decisions about their CCA choices in Primary 3 and beyond. It is an excellent opportunity for students to develop new skills, make new friends, and have fun while doing so.

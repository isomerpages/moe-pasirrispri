**D2C@PRPS** or **_‘Discover, Dream and Create Possibilities’_**

The school is committed to evoking passion for learning beyond the classroom, equipping Pasirians to think through real-life problems and issues critically and encouraging a dare-to-innovate spirit especially during this time of constant change, disruption and uncertainty in a VUCA environment. D2C@PRPS is intentionally designed to complement existing key school programmes, create synergy and coherence across students’ learning experiences. Through this, we want to provide Pasirians with holistic learning experiences that will equip them with dispositions and skillsets that will stand them in good stead for the future. The theme of ‘Sustainability’ is chosen in response to the pressing climate and environmental challenges facing our world today. We envision our P3-P6 Pasirians to become eco-inventors and entrepreneurs as they journey with us in D2C@PRPS.

The objectives of the programme are to:

1. provide learning opportunities for students to connect knowledge and skills with the real world.
2. allow students to go through design thinking process of sense-making, reflecting, challenging the status quo and solving problems creatively.
3. allow students to lead with vision and care, collaborate with partners and generate ideas and possibilities for the betterment of others.
4. instil in our students the dispositions of respect, serving others and advocating worthy causes responsibly for the good of society.

**Key Highlights**

     **I.**        **Community Partners**

D2C seeks to establish quality and purposeful partnerships. Through involvement with community partners, Pasirians would be able to discover and make sense of real world issues through observations and meaningful dialogue. The knowledge and skills gained from the collaboration will help Pasirians as they ideate and design innovative prototypes, test and implement solutions which meet the needs of the community.

    **II.**        **Student Agency**

D2C will also provide students with the opportunity to exercise their voice/choice to acquire and deepen skills beyond the curriculum. Students will have a variety of learning opportunities, ranging from STEM, ICT & Media and communication skills, that they may then apply towards their solution/prototype.

      

     **III.**        **Empowering Learners, Growing Leaders**

D2C consists of two modules which would be run over 2 years at the middle and upper primary levels respectively. Guided by the design thinking approach, each module is designed to provide students with opportunities to build up their skills and the runway to create, test and refine prototypes. This is an important part of the learning process as it will helps students to develop a dare-to-fail and dare-to-innovate spirit. Each module will culminate in the D2C@PRPS Week, where students will be given a platform to showcase their prototypes to their peers and partners.

D2C complements the school’s core academic and student development programmes to help Pasirians develop their critical inventive thinking skills, connect knowledge across subject disciplines, stretch their imagination, and apply these in authentic settings. D2C also aims to help students appreciate the relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic curriculum and to develop stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge and skills. Through their learning, we hope our students will grow to develop and advocate innovative and sustainable solutions to solve real world problems in the community.

### P3 Learning Journey to the Zoo

To engage our pupils in the learning of Science, we believe in maximizing the use of resources within and outside the school. Hence learning journeys for all pupils form an integral part of the science curriculum in Pasir Ris Primary so that learning becomes authentic, fun and meaningful. Pupils learn in a different environment when they go on learning journeys. Their five senses are stimulated throughout the journey. For example, the P3 pupils who visit the Singapore Zoological Gardens are given the opportunity to observe the characteristics of different animal groups such as mammals, birds and fish closely. They also learn that teamwork and cooperation is important for them to be able to complete their tasks. It is definitely a fun way of learning and bonding for teachers and pupils!

Every child a seed – A collaborative project with NParks and Pasir Ris Primary School

As Singapore commemorates 50 years of greening in 2013, Pasir Ris Primary School is happy to collaborate with National Parks Board, Singapore in this project – ‘Every Child a Seed’.

It seeks to convey to our pupils that every Singaporean plays a part in shaping our city in a garden. Tailored to complement the Primary 3 Science syllabus on diversity and system, it aims to generate greater awareness and discussions amongst pupils about the life cycle of a plant, plant parts and their functions as each pupil is tasked with the responsibility of looking after a plant from its germination to its growth and reproduction of flowers and fruits. It is also a good platform for pupils to practise the values of care and responsibility while taking care of their growing plant and for them to bask in the joy of its growth.

### Chocolate Creation Workshop

All P4 classes have been attending this enrichment workshop which is tied in with the topic on Heat since 2009. The workshop provides an authentic learning experience which allows the pupils to apply their understanding of heat transfer, heat gain and heat loss to the context of the workshop. Pupils especially enjoy watching their liquid chocolate set before their eyes and finally get to enjoy the fruits of their labour. Science teachers also observe that pupils are motivated by the task and are very engaged in the activities. The learning gleaned from the workshop can also be retained longer by most pupils.

### Learning Journey to the DNA Lab @ Science Centre

Students are given a chance to be ‘scientists’ for two days at the Science Centre where their learning is further enriched. Usually abstract concepts in class would be supported by classes at the Science Centre, whenever the opportunity is available.

### P6 PET Rocket Workshop

As part of our aim to promote experiential and inter-disciplinary learning among our pupils, the Science Department has been organizing PET Rocket® Junior Workshop for the P6 cohort since 2012. Pupils have an opportunity to design, construct and launch a rocket using recycled materials. The PET Rocket®, which the pupils work in pairs to construct, is compressed with air and water. The rockets are released in an upward direction and pupils use this tool to learn many concepts about motion, forces and energy.

### P6 Outdoor Learning @ Pasir Ris Mangrove Swamp

**Objectives**

*   To provide authentic learning experiences for pupils to explore and appreciate the mangrove swamp habitat.
*   To inculcate in pupils value of respect and being responsible towards the environment and the organisms living in it.
*   To develop pupils into compassionate individuals and show concern for Man’s impact on the environment.

All P6 pupils visit the Pasir Ris Mangrove Swamp to study the biodiversity of living things living within.  They observe, collect and record information regarding the interacting factors within this habitat.  At the end of the learning journey, pupils compile learning logbooks and carry out personal reflections on what they have learnt. This activity is aligned to the Upper Block Science Curriculum theme on Interaction – topics such as Adaptation, Food Web and Interaction Within The Environment are covered.  Though this learning journey, pupils have fun and learn better in an authentic environment.  They also learn to appreciate how human actions affect the environment they live in and hence the importance of taking actions to preserve it.

### P6 Post Exam Learning Journey @ River Safari

**Objectives**

*   To engage the senses, imagination and creativity of our pupils through “living classrooms”.
*   To generate greater awareness and appreciation in our pupils the interdependency of nature’s inhabitants and its significance.

P6 classes go on post exam learning journey at River Safari to learn about the role of biodiversity in an ecosystem. It engages the pupils in learning using their senses, imagination and creativity.  The ‘Living Classroom’ takes everyone on a learning journey that highlights the interdependency of nature’s inhabitants and the significance of appreciating them.

### PSLE Science Star Enrichment Workshops

To stretch our pupils and better prepare them to tackle PSLE Science questions, the Science Department has been organising the Science PSLE Revision cum Application of Process Skills Workshops exclusively for the Primary 6 pupils. The objectives are to boost pupils’ understanding of important Science concepts through hands-on activities, interactive discussions, graphic organisers and follow-up worksheet exercises, develop pupils’ problem-solving skills, especially in process thinking and train pupils to analyse and answer exam questions concisely.

The topics covered include “Cycles in Living Things, Cycles in Matter & Water, Plant System, Human System, Electrical System, Interactions in the Environment, Interaction of Forces and Energy, Forms & Uses” as these are deemed challenging ones from pupils’ and parents’ feedback.

### Holistic Assessment and Innovative Curriculum

**P3 Performance Task – Science Trail**

To promote collaborative and self-directed learning, an e-trail is incorporated as part of the primary three Science performance tasks. Armed with iPads, pupils visit various parts of the school to complete a Science trail activity on the plants found within the school compound.

This activity provides authentic learning experiences for pupils as they observe different types of plants and the various plant parts. Pupils also get to read up and listen to information on plants using their iPads while they are at the various stations of the trail. Pupils work in pairs, taking photographs of the plant parts and uploading them onto the school’s online learning portal.

At the end of the trail, pupils also reflect on their learning and take videos of their reflections.

### Science Competitions

**EZ Sc Symposium**

The Science department has been participating in the East Zone Enviro-Life Science Symposium organised by COE For Life-science, Dunman Secondary School since 2006. The objectives of the competition are to encourage innovation in Science Research for students, as well as to provide a competitive platform for students in the East Zone Schools to showcase their innovative Science Research projects.

The students’ research projects are assessed by judges comprising of scientists and science educators in Singapore.

The judging criteria on the day of presentation of students’ project include scientific Investigation, exploration of scientific thought, investigation design, analysis of data and evaluation as well as creativity, originality and future application.

In 2012, our group of P5 pupils did the school proud by clinching 1st prize in the primary school category with their project on organic pesticides. They were invited to present their project at the symposium and impressed the audience with their poise and confident presentation of the project.

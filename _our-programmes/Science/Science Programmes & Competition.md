### P3 Learning Journey to the Zoo

To engage our pupils in the learning of Science, we believe in maximizing the use of resources within and outside the school. Hence learning journeys for all pupils form an integral part of the science curriculum in Pasir Ris Primary so that learning becomes authentic, fun and meaningful. Pupils learn in a different environment when they go on learning journeys. Their five senses are stimulated throughout the journey. For example, the P3 pupils who visit the Singapore Zoological Gardens are given the opportunity to observe the characteristics of different animal groups such as mammals, birds and fish closely. They also learn that teamwork and cooperation is important for them to be able to complete their tasks. It is definitely a fun way of learning and bonding for teachers and pupils!

Every child a seed – A collaborative project with NParks and Pasir Ris Primary School

As Singapore commemorates 50 years of greening in 2013, Pasir Ris Primary School is happy to collaborate with National Parks Board, Singapore in this project – ‘Every Child a Seed’.

It seeks to convey to our pupils that every Singaporean plays a part in shaping our city in a garden. Tailored to complement the Primary 3 Science syllabus on diversity and system, it aims to generate greater awareness and discussions amongst pupils about the life cycle of a plant, plant parts and their functions as each pupil is tasked with the responsibility of looking after a plant from its germination to its growth and reproduction of flowers and fruits. It is also a good platform for pupils to practise the values of care and responsibility while taking care of their growing plant and for them to bask in the joy of its growth.

### Chocolate Creation Workshop

All P4 classes have been attending this enrichment workshop which is tied in with the topic on Heat since 2009. The workshop provides an authentic learning experience which allows the pupils to apply their understanding of heat transfer, heat gain and heat loss to the context of the workshop. Pupils especially enjoy watching their liquid chocolate set before their eyes and finally get to enjoy the fruits of their labour. Science teachers also observe that pupils are motivated by the task and are very engaged in the activities. The learning gleaned from the workshop can also be retained longer by most pupils.

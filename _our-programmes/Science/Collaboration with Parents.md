### Parents’ Workshop – Answering PSLE Science Questions

At PRPS, we are aware of parents being partners in our students’ academics. Therefore, we provide avenues for them to bring their concerns to us as well as to learn more about the education system.

As Science is introduced from Primary 3, parents need more information about this subject. We conduct workshops for parents at various levels so that they are more aware and concerns are addressed.

First launched in July 2008, the Green for Hope project is a recycling campaign which encourages primary school children to help their less fortunate classmates through recycling. During Green for Hope, for every kilogramme of recyclable waste collected, CapitaLand Hope Foundation (CHF), the philanthropic arm of CapitaLand Limited, donates S$2 to the participating school’s welfare fund to help underprivileged students with basic education expenses. In total, CHF has donated S$5,000,000 to 154 primary schools’ welfare funds and is to date, CHF’s largest donation for a single project.

The Science department of Pasir Ris Primary School has been involved and engaged in the above project since its inception in 2008.To date,  with the collective efforts of our staff, pupils and partners, we have raised thousands of dollars towards the school’s pocket money fund for our needy pupils. In 2012, we are currently involved in the fourth year of this recycling campaign and have organised two rounds of collection for recyclables, mainly paper. Needless to say, the response from the staff and pupils have been really encouraging and positve. This is part of our department’s initiative to sustain the effort to encourage our pupils and staff to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.

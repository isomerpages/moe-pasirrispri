### Key Learning Points

The students learnt to be respectful and mindful of what and how they communicate with the residents. For example, coming  from the city they were quite apprehensive at first stepping onto a kampung house. They were advised and reminded not to be offensive especially on commenting the environment or facilities at the kampung. However at the same time, they also learnt not to judge a kampung as a backward environment. This was because the kampung that they visited was the first kampung in Malaysia that was self-sufficient in water. The students were impressed at the technology on water supply that the village had where the water from the river in the kampung was processed and distributed to the entire kampung via underground water pipes.

They learnt to be mindful about what they said to the residents at the Rumah Tumpangan Nur Salam which was a home for the children at risk and orphans. They were mindful that they should not ask personal questions like family background or the reason for being at the home. The students also learnt to be thankful for the blessings that they had in Singapore. They were touched to see the residents’ reactions when the latter received the school shoes and the food supplies that the Pasirians brought from Singapore. At the end of the service learning trip, the students wrote cards for the residents and they were touched when the residents reciprocated by singing a thank you song for them. Some had tears in their eyes.

# **Values In Action**

Every Pasirian embarks on their “Values in Action” (VIA) journey through various projects. To strengthen the effectiveness of VIA in our school, we adopted the four stages of learning from the structure of the Internalizing Values Framework – Raising Awareness, Creating Understanding, Building Good Habits of Action and Reflection – into the Form Teacher Guidance Period and Character and Citizenship Education lessons.  The two-week long lessons have helped to ensure that Pasirians are engaged and enjoy a more holistic learning experience.

The greater student ownership of this VIA learning experiences has encouraged them to find that VIA is more meaningful, and thus they are more motivated to continue making a difference to the community and nation after leaving school.

In John Ruskin’s words, we believe that ‘the highest reward for man’s toil is not what he gets for it but what he becomes by it.’ The impact of this VIA activity will not be felt without the care and dedication of our teachers who truly believe in inspiring our Pasirians to be **_Resilient_**, **_Respectful_**, _**Reflective**_ and _**Responsive**_ members of the community.

# **Values In Action**

Every Pasirian embarks on their “Values in Action” (VIA) journey through various projects. To strengthen the effectiveness of VIA in our school, we adopted the four stages of learning from the structure of the Internalizing Values Framework – Raising Awareness, Creating Understanding, Building Good Habits of Action and Reflection – into the Form Teacher Guidance Period and Character and Citizenship Education lessons.  The two-week long lessons have helped to ensure that Pasirians are engaged and enjoy a more holistic learning experience.

The greater student ownership of this VIA learning experiences has encouraged them to find that VIA is more meaningful, and thus they are more motivated to continue making a difference to the community and nation after leaving school.

In John Ruskin’s words, we believe that ‘the highest reward for man’s toil is not what he gets for it but what he becomes by it.’ The impact of this VIA activity will not be felt without the care and dedication of our teachers who truly believe in inspiring our Pasirians to be **_Resilient_**, **_Respectful_**, _**Reflective**_ and _**Responsive**_ members of the community.

### Project Care

Since 2010, PRPS organises Project CARE which aims to encourage Pasirians to spare a thought for the less fortunate children around the world and to show care and concern. In the past years, Pasirians have been lending their hands and spending time at orphanages in Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia. In conjunction with Children’s Day, Project CARE is organised to instill in our students the importance of showing kindness to others regardless of nationality, race and religion. This kindness will lead to Singapore being a more gracious society.

We alternate the Hygiene Kit and the Pencil case projects. In the Hygiene Kit project, Pasirians filled up pouches with five basic hygiene needs – a toothbrush, toothpaste, bar of soap, nail clipper and face towel. In the Pencil Case project, Pasirians filled up pencil cases with basic stationeries – 2 pencils, a sharpener, an eraser, a ruler and a set of colour pencils or crayons. The filled pouches and pencil cases were donated to the needy and underprivileged children who are living in the rural areas in the neighbouring countries of Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia.

By being involved in this project, the students were able to internalise the school’s value of Share and Care and extend their care and concern to the children around our region. They also were able to display the importance of showing kindness to others regardless of nationality, race and religion. We hope this small gesture of sharing and giving will bring more smiles to the underprivileged children in the region.

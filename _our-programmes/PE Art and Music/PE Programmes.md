# **PE Programmes**

PE is an integral component of the school’s holistic curriculum as it plays an important role in the physical, social, mental growth and development of our pupils. The school PE department aims to equip every child with the knowledge, competencies, attitude and values towards the pursuit of a lifelong physically active and healthy lifestyle.

Through PE, students acquire a variety of skills and knowledge that involve them in healthy physical activities. Students will learn the basic skills and rules necessary to participate in games at the recreational level. With a spiral and progressive approach to skill and knowledge development, students at the lower primary are equipped with fundamental movements and psychomotor skills that lay the foundations for their motor learning. These skills will be further developed at the upper primary levels together with games concept such as keeping possession, creating attack and defending space. In addition, through the cooperative lessons and modified games, our pupils develop valuable character traits such as team work, resilience, responsibility and respect amongst peers.

The PE Department has also embarked on Assessment for Learning. PE teachers use rubrics and performance indicators to provide students with meaningful feedback to further enhance their learning. As part of the assessment, students are also given time to reflect and evaluate their/peer performance. Teachers provide constructive meaningful feedback and guidance to students to improve their psychomotor (movement/skills) and cognitive understanding of the concept and techniques taught. Feedback given helps to increase students’ motivation and engagement and helps create a positive learning environment.

This is an on-going process across all levels for all students. At the end of every semester, a holistic development report will be provided for parents.

The PE Department also organizes the following programs and events to provide our pupils with a broad and balanced curriculum for all to experience the joy of learning:

*   Program for Active Learning (PAL) P1 & P2
*   FITOPIA (P1 -P6)

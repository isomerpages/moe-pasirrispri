Physical Education (PE) is a crucial aspect of the school's curriculum as it plays a vital role in the holistic development of our students. The PE department aims to foster a lifelong love of physical activity and healthy living in every child. This is achieved through a dynamic and engaging curriculum that teaches essential physical skills, such as coordination, agility, balance, and endurance, while also promoting sportsmanship, teamwork, and leadership.

Our PE program adopts a spiral and progressive approach to skill and knowledge development, ensuring that students receive a comprehensive and well-rounded education. At the lower primary level, students will be introduced to fundamental movements and psychomotor skills, which will lay the foundation for their motor learning. As they progress to the upper primary levels, they will build upon these skills, developing an understanding of games concepts such as possession, attacking, and defense. This approach allows students to continuously build upon their skills and knowledge, resulting in a deeper understanding of Physical Education and a lifelong appreciation for an active and healthy lifestyle.

In PE classes, students will also have the opportunity to develop their social and emotional skills. Through the various physical sports activities and a focus on sportsmanship, students will learn how to work effectively with others, communicate effectively, and build positive relationships. Our PE teachers are dedicated to ensuring that every student, regardless of their level of interest or ability, is included and feels comfortable participating. The inclusive and supportive learning environment encourages all students to reach their potential and fosters a positive and healthy school culture.
To enhance the educational journey of our students, the PE curriculum covers seven key learning areas. It ensures that students receive a diverse range of experiences and are exposed to different sports activities and skills, promoting physical, social, and emotional growth and development. The seven learning areas provide a balanced approach to PE and allow students to gain a deep understanding of the benefits of an active and healthy lifestyle while developing their physical skills and abilities.

The PE Department has been implementing Assessment for Learning since 2016, with the goal of providing students with meaningful feedback to help them progress and succeed in their PE classes. Our PE teachers utilize performance indicators and rubrics to assess student performance and provide targeted feedback on both psychomotor skills and cognitive understanding of the concepts and techniques taught.

This approach allows students to reflect on their own performance and evaluate their progress, as well as gain valuable insights through constructive feedback from their teachers. The feedback given is intended to increase students' motivation and engagement, creating a positive and supportive learning environment.

At the end of each semester, parents will receive a comprehensive report on their child's holistic development in Physical Education, including a summary of their performance, areas of strength, and areas for improvement. This report will provide a valuable insight into their child's growth and development and help support their ongoing success in Physical Education.

In addition to regular Physical Education classes, the PE Department also organizes a range of programs and events to further broaden and enrich the students' learning experiences. These initiatives are designed to enhance their physical, social, and emotional development, promoting a lifelong love of physical activity and healthy living.

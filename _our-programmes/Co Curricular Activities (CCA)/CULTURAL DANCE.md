<p>Cultural Dance is one of the most vibrant CCAs offered in Pasir Ris Primary,
with a lineup of performances each year for a diversity of school events.
It is an intrinsic part of the school’s cultural scene which offers a fun
and interactive platform allowing members to express, create and innovate.
It is for students who love expressing themselves on stage and performing
to an audience!</p>
<p>The CCA aims to develop every pupil into a passionate, confident and versatile
performer. The objectives are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To provide students with extensive opportunities to showcase their talents
and also share the joy of dancing with the audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To build self-confidence and deepen the pupils knowledge on dance skills
and structure through the varieties of dance styles: Cultural Dance, Contemporary
Dance and Urban Dance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage self- expression and promote the love for dance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cultural Dance Leaders are empowered to lead the team with the Peer-guidance
activities which includes warming up exercises and reflections sessions
that is conducted before and after each training.</p>
<p>Team bonding sessions are geared towards team spirit, character building
discipline and courage. It also provides a platform for the dancers to
share their challenges and learning experience that arises during their
dance sessions.</p>

the Chinese New Year Concert virtually. Every pupil will be given an opportunity
to perform on stage during their journey in the Dance CCA.&nbsp; A group
of dancers also participated in the street dance competition organized
by Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning.</p>

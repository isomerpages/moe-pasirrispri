<p>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) play a vital role in enhancing the educational
experiences of our students by providing them with opportunities to develop
their skills, knowledge, and interests beyond the classroom. These activities
are designed to offer a well-rounded development of students, covering
areas such as aesthetics, cognitive, sports and social-emotional well-being.
Through their participation in CCA, students are able to explore and discover
their passions, interests, and skills. This exploration can help students
build self-confidence, foster their creativity, and develop a strong sense
of self-identity.</p>
<p>The CCA program is also designed to provide students with opportunities
to enhance their character and 21st-century competencies through planned
and meaningful activities. It provides a platform for students to form
meaningful relationships and friendships, as well as collaborate with others
to achieve common goals. By participating in these experiences, students
have the opportunity to develop new skills</p>

<p><strong>Three main Categories of CCA</strong>
</p>
<p>The school provides a diverse selection of Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)
organized into three main groups, offering students a wide range of options
to choose from based on their interests and skills. The availability of
a variety of CCAs allows students to find an activity that aligns with
their interests and supports their personal growth. The grouping of CCAs
into three main categories helps to simplify the selection process and
provides students with a clear understanding of the different options available
to them. The school's commitment to offering a comprehensive and inclusive
CCA program is a testament to its dedication to providing students with
opportunities for holistic development.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 2 CCA Modular Experience Program (MEP)</strong>
</p>
<p>The program is designed to give our students an opportunity to explore
their interests and discover their strengths. This program aims to provide
a hands-on and engaging experience for Primary 2 students by allowing them
to try out <strong>three different</strong> CCAs. This will help them to
identify the activities that they enjoy the most and have the potential
to excel in. The program is designed to be inclusive and all Primary 2
students are strongly encouraged to participate. The MEP is a valuable
experience that will lay the foundation for students to make informed decisions
about their CCA choices in Primary 3 and beyond. It is an excellent opportunity
for students to develop new skills, make new friends, and have fun while
doing so.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 3 - 6</strong>
</p>
<p>The following CCA is open to all Primary 3 to Primary 6 students and is
designed to provide students with opportunities to explore their interests,
develop new skills, and engage with their peers. Participation in CCA is
highly encouraged and is an integral part of a well-rounded education.
To ensure that students have the chance to focus and develop their skills
in a single area, each student is limited to participating in only <strong>one CCA</strong> from
any of the available groups.</p>

<p><strong>Change of CCA</strong>
</p>
<p>At our school, we believe that a student’s growth and development are
best supported through sustained participation in their chosen CCA. By
remaining in the same CCA, students are given the time and space to deepen
their skills, build meaningful friendships, develop resilience, and take
on greater responsibilities over the years. Frequent changes of CCA may
limit these opportunities for growth and continuity.</p>
<p>For this reason, <strong>a change of CCA is strongly discouraged</strong>.
However, we understand that there may be valid reasons for a change, and
parents may submit a request between <strong>1 January – 10 January</strong> and <strong>1 July – 10 July</strong> using
this <a href="https://forms.moe.edu.sg/forms/oa0YNq" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">link</a> or
QR code provided below. Please note that apart from medical reasons, no
requests will be considered outside of this window. Students who require
a change in CCA due to urgent medical reasons may email HOD PE / CCA with
the doctor’s letter outside of the window period.</p>
<p>Please note the following prerequisites before requesting for a change
of CCA:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The student has been committed to their current CCA for at least one semester
(6 months).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student is not scheduled to represent the school in upcoming competitions
or performances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student will continue to attend their current CCA sessions while the
request is being processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Primary 6 students, no change of CCA is allowed.</p>
<p></p>

</ul>
<p>Parents will receive the outcome of the request via Parents Gateway (PG)
by the end of the month (January / July). <strong>Please note that the outcome of each request is also dependent on the availability of vacancies in the CCA, and submission of a request does not guarantee a change.</strong> We
seek your partnership and understanding in helping your child gain the
most from their CCA journey.</p>

<h1><strong>CCA</strong></h1>
<p>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) play a vital role in enhancing the educational
experiences of our students by providing them with opportunities to develop
their skills, knowledge, and interests beyond the classroom. These activities
are designed to offer a well-rounded development of students, covering
areas such as aesthetics, cognitive, sports and social-emotional well-being.
Through their participation in CCA, students are able to explore and discover
their passions, interests, and skills. This exploration can help students
build self-confidence, foster their creativity, and develop a strong sense
of self-identity.</p>
<p>The CCA program is also designed to provide students with opportunities
to enhance their character and 21st-century competencies through planned
and meaningful activities. It provides a platform for students to form
meaningful relationships and friendships, as well as collaborate with others
to achieve common goals. By participating in these experiences, students
have the opportunity to develop new skills</p>

<p><strong>Three main Categories of CCA</strong>
</p>
<p>The school provides a diverse selection of Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)
organized into three main groups, offering students a wide range of options
to choose from based on their interests and skills. The availability of
a variety of CCAs allows students to find an activity that aligns with
their interests and supports their personal growth. The grouping of CCAs
into three main categories helps to simplify the selection process and
provides students with a clear understanding of the different options available
to them. The school's commitment to offering a comprehensive and inclusive
CCA program is a testament to its dedication to providing students with
opportunities for holistic development.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 2 CCA Modular Experience Program (MEP)</strong>
</p>
<p>The program is designed to give our students an opportunity to explore
their interests and discover their strengths. This program aims to provide
a hands-on and engaging experience for Primary 2 students by allowing them
to try out <strong>three different</strong> CCAs. This will help them to
identify the activities that they enjoy the most and have the potential
to excel in. The program is designed to be inclusive and all Primary 2
students are strongly encouraged to participate. The MEP is a valuable
experience that will lay the foundation for students to make informed decisions
about their CCA choices in Primary 3 and beyond. It is an excellent opportunity
for students to develop new skills, make new friends, and have fun while
doing so.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 3 - 6</strong>
</p>
<p>The following CCA is open to all Primary 3 to Primary 6 students and is
designed to provide students with opportunities to explore their interests,
develop new skills, and engage with their peers. Participation in CCA is
highly encouraged and is an integral part of a well-rounded education.
To ensure that students have the chance to focus and develop their skills
in a single area, each student is limited to participating in only <strong>one CCA</strong> from
any of the available groups.</p>

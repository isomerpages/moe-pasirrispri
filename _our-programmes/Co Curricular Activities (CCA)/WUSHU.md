<p>Wushu is considered a “performing sport”, consisting elements that are
characteristic to both the sports and performing arts. Wushu is derived
from Chinese martial arts and it teaches “Wu De”（武德）, which is the martial
code of conduct. Learners and practitioners of Wushu are expected to display
excellence in their moral character and to uphold integrity and moral courage
at all times.</p>

<p>Wushu improves one’s flexibility, speed, strength, coordination and endurance.
It also instils discipline and respect for others and for oneself. Unlike
any other contact sport, Wushu is considered relatively safe due to its
performance nature.</p>
<p>Wushu is gaining popularity nationwide as more parents and students are
coming to recognise the benefits that learning Wushu could reap, be in
terms of health or character development.</p>
<p>Our Team Singapore has also done the nation proud by constantly achieving
excellent results in the SEA Games. Wushu is truly an emerging sport to
be enjoyed by all Singaporeans, especially the youths.</p>

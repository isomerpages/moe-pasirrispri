<p>About the Guzheng</p>
<p>The Guzheng is a traditional Chinese plucked zither dating from the Qin
dynasty. It is an ancestor of several other zither-like instruments found
across East Asia such as the Japanese Koto, Kayagum in Korea and Dan Tranh
in Vietnam. A modern Guzheng typically has 21 strings over movable bridges,
mounted on large resonant half-tube box made of wu-tong wood and is typically
about 1.7m long. Silk strings were originally used but modern guzhengs
have metal strings or metal strings wrapped with nylon.</p>
<p>Players wear finger picks and the notes are generally plucked with the
right hand. Sometimes virtuoso performers will use finger picks on both
hands. Nowadays, the guzheng is played in style of traditional, classical,
Jazz, Fusion, Pop, Hip-Hop and more. Guzheng players also adapted techniques
from the piano and harp.</p>

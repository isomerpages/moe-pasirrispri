and a ball. Since it was established, Floorball remains one of the most
popular CCAs in PRPS. Currently, there are more than 120 active and committed

<p>Floorball is exciting to play due to the fast pace and variability during
matches. Beyond just about the fun, however, students are also able to
improve their stamina, strength and agility. They become stronger and more
resilient players.</p>

<p>In PRPS’ Floorball CCA, we do not just get students to focus on their
skills and fitness; instead, we look at the holistic development of students.
Our student outcomes and school values are the foundation when we plan
and conduct trainings in schools. We aim to groom students into resilient
and responsible leaders, compassionate and confident Pasirians.</p>
